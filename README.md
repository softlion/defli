# Welcome !

This repo holds scripts to add some dual mining on some Helium hotspots.

THIS GITHUB REPO IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH DEFLI NOR WINGBITS NOR ANY OTHER COMPANY.

It is built on my spare time.

# Scripts

Execute Defli then Wingbits scripts, in this order. You don't need to complete defli infos but you need to run the defli script first.

The `.ps1` scripts for windows machines will ssh to the given IP and executes the `.sh` script on it.  Instead you can run the ".sh" script directly from a ssh session on the target device.

It supports both balena and docker, so it can run on Pisces, Sensecap, Nebra, and other Raspberry PI devices having docker or balena installed. It will create configuration folders in /mnt/data/ though.

The scripts will ask you all required info for onboarding. You can run the script multiple times, for example to change the location of elevation.
